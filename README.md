## Description
This fully backend application involves use of databases and MySQL, manipulating data using javascript and no front end HTML since this is a command line application. The app is not deployed, therefore a video is linked below demonstrating the usage and functionality of the app.

## Installation
The Inquirer npm package is required to handle processing of questions and answers, as well as mySQL2 to manipulate the database using javascript. My local system uses NodeJS to run javascript as well.

## Usage
Run the server.js javascript file. Use the command node server.js to run the file. Users will be greeted with a prompt and multiple options as to what they would like to do regarding the employee database. Selecting one of the listed options will allow users to follow along with the prompts to update the database.

## Future Improvements
Some of the code ends prematurely. I intend to go over the incorrectly running functions in the future in order to be able to fix these functions.
